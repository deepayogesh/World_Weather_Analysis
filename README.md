# World_Weather_Analysis

Weather database project stores the data for cities generated by generating randomize longitude and latitude. 
Weather database created and stored in the csv file. Using this database, we added a new column to it to store the weather description of the city . 
With the help of preferred temperature, we filtered the data based on condition. This data was used to find the potential travel destination and the travel itinerary for the customer.
Using Google Map Directions API, created the travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
